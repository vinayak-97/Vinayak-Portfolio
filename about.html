<h1>About Me : </h1>
<p style="margin: 10px;">
    Greetings,<br> <br>

    I am Vinayak Bhosale <b>(Software Engineer / Data Scientist) </b>, a highly motivated professional with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the esteemed University of Central Florida. My academic background, coupled with my extensive practical experience, equips me with a versatile skill set that spans various domains within the tech industry. <br> <br>

    My career aspirations are broad and encompass roles in Front-End and Back-End development, as well as proficiency in Full Stack development. I also possess a deep passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Database management. This multifaceted skill set allows me to contribute effectively to a wide range of projects and industries. <br> <br>

    I am proud to have contributed to the academic world through the publication of research, notably in the International Journal of Management Technology and Engineering, where I explored the application of Li-Fi technology. In addition, I have actively contributed to the open-source community by developing and publishing two Python packages related to deep learning and machine learning. You can find these packages on PyPI, the official Python package repository, demonstrating my commitment to sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration. 
    In the realm of education and knowledge sharing, I host a YouTube channel, Tycomac Codes, where I create educational content related to coding and technology. <br> <br>

    Furthermore, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of relocating anywhere within the United States, as I am committed to pursuing opportunities that will both challenge and broaden my expertise. My academic achievements, professional experiences, and commitment to continuous learning make me a valuable asset to any organization or project. <br> <br>
